and pried the company to come and see you honey<BR>

<B>RIPCORD</B><BR>
 soul destroyed<BR>
with clever toys<BR>
for little boys<BR>

you feel it till you've had enough<BR>
and you don't understand<BR>
no ripcord<BR>
aeroplane<BR>
do to me what I mean<BR>
it's inevitable inevitable aeroplane<BR>
a thousand miles an hour<BR>
the politics of power<BR>
still you don't understand<BR>
no ripcord<BR>
the answer to your prayers<BR>
no ripcord<BR>
<BR>
<B>VEGETBLE</B> <BR>
i never wanted anything but this<BR>
i worked hard<BR>
tried hard<BR>
i ran around in domestic bliss<BR>
i fought hard<BR>
died hard <BR>
everytime<BR>
you're running out of here<BR>
everytime<BR>
you're running i get the fear <BR>
i never wanted any broken bones<BR>
scarred face<BR>
no home<BR>
you worked around it and asphyxiate<BR>
and i burn<BR>
all hate <BR>
everytime<BR>
you're running out of here<BR>
everytime<BR>
you're running i can see <BR>
i'm not a vegetable<BR>
i will not control myself<BR>
i spit on the hand that feeds me<BR>
i will not control myself <BR>
the waters spray<BR>
the waters roll all over me<BR>
the waters spray<BR>
the waters roll on this tired human<BR>
<BR>
<B>I CAN'T</B><BR>
please forget the words that i just blurted out<BR>
it wasn't me it was a strange and creepy doubt <BR>
they keep driving in my cage<BR>
there's nothing in this world to keep the time <BR>
even though i might<BR>
even though i try<BR>
i can't <BR>
see the things that keep keep me uninvolved<BR>
silly words that i that i can't live without <BR>
if you give up on me now<BR>
i'll be gutted like i've never been before<BR>
even though i might<BR>
even though i try<BR>
i can't <BR>
<BR>
<B>LURGEE</B><BR>
i feel better<BR>
i feel better now you've gone <BR>
i got better<BR>
i got better i got strong <BR>
i feel better<BR>
i feel better now there's nothing wrong <BR>
i got better<BR>
i got better i got strong <BR>
tell me something<BR>
tell me something I don't know <BR>
tell me one thing<BR>
tell me one thing let it go <BR>
i got something<BR>
i got something heaven knows <BR>
i got something<BR>
i got something i don't know <BR>
<BR>
<B>BLOW OUT</B><BR>
in my mind<BR>
could never turn my heel<BR>
all the time killing what I feel<BR>
and everything I touch<BR>
all wrapped up in cotton wool<BR>
all wrapped up in sugar coated pils<BR>
turns to stone<BR>
and everything i touchall wrapped up in cotton wool<BR>
all wrapped up in sugar coated pils<BR>
i infuse just in case i blow out<BR>
i am plain just in case i crack up<BR>
everything i touch turns to stone<BR>
<BR>
