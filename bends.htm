but it will not form. you can crush it but it's always here. <BR>
you can crush it but it's always near chasing you home saying <BR>
everything is broken everyone is broken. you can force it <BR>
but it will stay stung. you can crush it as dry as a bone. <BR>
you can walk it home straight from the school. <BR>
you can kiss it you break all the rules but still  <BR>
everything is broken, everyone is broken. why can't you forget?<BR>

<B>fake plastic trees</B><BR>
her green plastic watering can for her fake chinese rubber plant <BR>
in the fake plastic earth<BR>
that she bought from the rubber man in a town full of rubber plans <BR>
to get rid of itself<BR>
it wears her out She lives with a broken man, <BR>
a cracked polystyreneman who just crumbles and burns.<BR>
He used to do a durgery for the girls in the eighties but <BR>
GRAVITY always wins and wears him out.<BR>
She looks like a real thing. She tastes like a real thing, <BR>
my fake plastic love.<BR>

If I coud just turn and run. and it wears me out.<BR>
If I could be who you wanted all the time..<BR>
<BR>
<B>high'n'dry</B><BR>

you'd kill yourself for recognition. kill yourself to never ever stop. <BR>
you brokeanother mirror. you are turning into something you are not<BR>
don't leave me dry, don't leave me high<BR>
drying up in conversation<BR>
you'll be the one who cannot talk.<BR>
all your insides fall to pieces you just sit there <BR>
wishing you could still make love.<BR>
they the ones who'll hate you when you think you've got the world <BR>
all sussed out. they're the ones who'll spit at you. <BR>
you'll be the one screaming out.<BR>
it's the best thing that you ever had.<BR>
<BR>

you've changed the locks 3 times, he still comes reeling through the door. <BR>
and soon he'll get to you, teach you how to get the purest hell.<BR>
you do it to yourself you do and that's what realy hurts is <BR>
you do it to yourself just you, <BR>
you and no-one else you do it to yourself.<BR>

what is eating you.<BR>
i try to stay awake but its 58hrs since that i last slept with you.<BR>
what are we coming to?<BR>
i just don't know any more.<BR>
i get on the train and just stand about now that i don't think of you.<BR>
i keep falling over i keep passing out when i see a face like you. <BR>
what am i coming to?  i'm gonna melt down.<BR>
<BR>
<B>sulk</B><BR>
you bite through the big wall<BR>
the big wall bites back<BR>
you sit there and sulk sit there and bawl<BR>
you are so pretty when you are on yout knees<BR>
disinfected eager to please<BR>
sometimes you sulk sometimes you burn god rest your soul<BR>
when the loving comes and whe have already gone <BR>
just like your dad you'll never change<BR>
each time it comes it eats me alive<BR>
i try to behave but it eats me alive<BR>
so i declaire a holiday  fall asleep drift away.<BR>
<BR>
<B>street spirit (fade out)</B><BR>
rows of houses all bearing down on me  <BR>
I can feel their blue hands touching me alll these things <BR>
in all positions  all these things will one day take control <BR>
and fade out again and fade out again<BR>
this machine will   will not communicate  these thougts  <BR>
and the straight I'm under<BR>
be a world child form a circle before we all go under<BR>
and fade out again and fade out again<BR>
cracked eggs dead birds scream as they fight for life<BR>
I can feel death can see it's bleady eyes<BR>
all these things into frution<BR>
all these things  we'll one day swallow whole<BR>
and fade out again and fade out again<BR>
                  .immerse your soul in LOVE<BR>
